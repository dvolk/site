With a bit of searching, it's possible to find these and many more books
on the  internet completely  for free.  Sites that offer  them are  in a
_legally_ dubious position, but  publishers (academic and otherwise) are
themselves  _ethically_ questionable  and are  perhaps the  bigger evil.
Decide for yourself.
